"""SCETlib autodiff backend: cached matched sigma_UL with exact derivatives.

Thin, numpy-facing wrapper around ``ScetlibCachedXsecTF``
(``scetlib-cms/py/scetlib_tf.py``). It owns three things the param model should
not have to know about:

* rebuilding the SCETlib calculation exactly as the cache was prepared with
  (``configure_calculation`` is NOT the whole configuration -- the profile-scale
  / b* block and the nonperturbative models go through
  ``variations.set_vary``, so skipping it
  silently keeps the C++ defaults);
* loading the one-file cache (compressed bin rules for the resummed piece +
  frozen fixed-order grid for the nonsingular one) and checking it belongs to
  this configuration;
* mapping the cache's bin list onto the fit's gen grid, by an explicit
  permutation rather than by assuming both were generated in the same order.

Derivatives come from C++: ``values_and_jacobian`` returns value and Jacobian
from one call, ``hessian`` the exact per-bin Hessian. The param model injects
those into the TF graph as a local quadratic, so nothing here needs to be
differentiable.

Runtime requirements (inside the WRemnants singularity):
``source <scetlib-cms>/setup.sh`` -- it puts ``scetlib_qT`` and ``scetlib_run``
on ``PYTHONPATH``, the shared libraries on ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, and lifts the
stack limit (the bT integrators are deep). LHAPDF and the per-member beamfunc
grids under ``share/scetlib/beamfunc/`` must be reachable.

    ``prod/scetlib_run/defaults.conf``, configure the calculation, apply the
    card's electroweak parameters and fiducial volumes, then apply variation 0
    (central) through ``set_vary`` -- which is what installs the profile-scale
    / b* block and the nonperturbative models. Finally enable the frozen-node
    cache on both sub-pieces, without which the rule replay has nothing to
    replay against.

    ``configure_ew_parameters`` and ``configure_fiducial_volumes`` are NOT
    optional and are NOT part of ``configure_calculation``. Skipping them
    silently keeps SCETlib's default electroweak inputs while the card
    specifies its own -- measured as a flat **1.61%** normalization error
    against the production driver on the analysis card, which sets
    ``mZ = 91.1535``, ``GammaZ = 2.4932``, a custom ``alphaem``, ``sin2_thw``
    and CKM. With them applied, ``operator()`` here reproduces
    ``scetlib-run-qT.py`` to 1e-9. Both were once missing from the upstream
    example, which now applies them too -- do not "simplify" either away.

    ``diff_scales`` registers muR and the three matching transition points as
    differentiable parameters (``scale_kappa_R``, ``scale_x1..x3``, plus an inert
    ``scale_kappa_F`` slot that ``build_pdf_variations`` ties the muF pair to).
    It REQUIRES ``muf_follows_muB = no``: with muf tied to muB a live kappa_R
    moves muF while the beam convolutions stay frozen at their own muF. It also
    changes the parameter registry, so a cache built without it cannot be loaded
    with it -- :class:`ScetlibADXsec` therefore reads the flag off the cache
    rather than assuming.

    ``fo_resolve_muR`` resolves the fixed-order muR dependence into the frozen
    grid so the FO piece follows kappa_R in closed form. It must be set BEFORE
    the grid is built -- enabling it afterwards invalidates the cache -- and it
    samples several scales, so the warm costs roughly 3x.
