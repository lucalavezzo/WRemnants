"""Moved from wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np on 2026-08-26: the response
loader is used by the autodiff param model's card path, and scetlib_np is
superseded. The scetlib_np copy is left in place for that package's own
workflow.

Load the (reco × gen) response matrix R for the ParamModel.

R lives in the unfolding histmaker output (a separate hdf5 from the fit tensor)
as ``nominal_prefsr_yieldsUnfolding`` under the Z sample group. Slice
``acceptance=True`` (gen-fiducial), project to reco × (ptVGen, absYVGen): this
SUMS the helicitySig axis. R is filled with the weight PARTITION
``nominal_weight_helicity`` whose 8 pieces add back up, so the physical yield is
the helicitySig SUM (NOT UL). The gen-total normalizer N_gen is filled with
``csAngularMoments`` and takes the UL component (``helicitySig=-1``); see
``_select_ul_helicity`` and the inline comment in ``load_R``. Full response-fold
formula and this SUM-vs-UL subtlety: :mod:`param_model` module docstring.
