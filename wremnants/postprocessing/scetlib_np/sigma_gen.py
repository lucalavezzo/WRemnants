"""SigmaGenModel — the datacard-free SCETlib NP σ_gen(λ) core (Steps 1–2).

The physics half of the SCETlib NP prediction, factored out of
:class:`~wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.param_model.SCETlibNPParamModel` so
it runs from a bT-grid directory, λ_central (with the np_model strings), and the
gen-bin edges — no rabbit / datacard / fit input. Owns Steps 1–2:

    Step 1   btgrid Hankel + Q integral  →  σ_resum(λ; g)   resummed, on the gen grid
    Step 2   + fixed-order matching      →  σ_gen(λ; g)

Step 2 adds σ_ns = FO_full − FO_singular, which is known only on the FO inputs'
own (matching) grid. When that grid refines the gen grid — every DYTurbo
correction — the matching is the plain sum σ_resum(g) + σ_ns(g). When it does not
(the coarse NNLOjet exports), σ_ns is applied as a multiplicative factor on its own
grid and carried into the gen bins by the resummed shape, mirroring how the
histmaker applies a coarse correction to a fine distribution. See
:meth:`SigmaGenModel._setup_matching`.

Every factor (b*, I_pert, C_ν, γ_ν^NP, F_eff, the arctan-Q² Q integral, the
|Y|-fold and qT→ptVGen rebin, σ_ns matching) is derived in the ``param_model.py``
module docstring; this class is that arithmetic without loader/fit-interface
concerns. Steps 3–4 (gen→reco fold, per-bin ratio) stay in
``SCETlibNPParamModel``, which holds a ``SigmaGenModel`` as ``self.core``.

``eff``/``gnu`` are dicts of the λ values plus the ``np_model`` /
``np_model_nu`` form strings, same shape as ``eff_central`` / ``gnu_central``.
Start from those and override the λ you want; un-supplied params stay at
λ_central. All tensors are TF, so ``sigma_gen`` is differentiable in λ.

    σ_ns is zeroed below ``qt_cutoff`` (as make_theory_corr does, via its

        """Compose σ_ns, known only on its matching grid M, with R's gen grid G.

        Two regimes, picked from the grids themselves:

        * **additive** — M refines G (every DYTurbo correction: those FO inputs are
          run on grids finer than the analysis binning). Each gen bin is then a
          union of whole matching bins and
              σ_gen(g; λ) = σ_resum(g; λ) + Σ_{B ⊂ g} σ_ns(B)
          is exact. This is the arithmetic the class has always done, kept
          bit-identical so existing corrections are untouched.
        * **multiplicative** — M does not refine G (the coarse NNLOjet stitched
          exports, whose grid intersects the analysis binning at ~0.5 in |Y| and
          1 GeV in qT). A σ_ns per gen bin is then not data, so the matching factor
          stays where σ_ns lives,
              f(B; λ) = 1 + σ_ns(B) / σ_resum(B; λ) ,
          and the fine resummed spectrum carries it into the gen bins over the
          refinement ref = edges(G) ∪ edges(M),
              σ_gen(g; λ) = Σ_{c ⊂ g} σ_resum(c; λ) · f(B(c); λ) .
          Summing over the c ⊂ B gives back σ_resum(B; λ) + σ_ns(B) exactly at
          EVERY λ, so the matching-grid total is conserved and only the sub-bin
          placement of σ_ns follows the resummed shape. That is the structure the
          histmaker applies — a coarse multiplicative correction on a fine
          distribution (MiNNLO's, there) — which is why the correction can be built
          on a grid coarser than the fit's without any bin having to line up.

        Matching bins whose σ_resum is not positive (forward/high-qT cells where the
        unmatched singular term dips negative) cannot carry a multiplicative factor;
        those fall back to an area-fraction additive split of σ_ns, which conserves
        the same per-B total."""
