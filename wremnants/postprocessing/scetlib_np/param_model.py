"""SCETlibNPParamModel — continuous-λ rabbit ParamModel for SCETlib NP.

Scales the signal reco template by a per-bin ratio of the SCETlib
nonperturbative (NP) prediction at the fitted λ vs at λ_central. Built in four
steps; :mod:`response_matrix`, :mod:`btgrid_tf` and the validation scripts refer
here for the derivation.

    Step 1   btgrid Hankel + Q integral   →  σ_resum(λ; g)   resummed, gen grid
    Step 2   + fixed-order matching       →  σ_gen(λ; g) = σ_resum + σ_ns
    Step 3   fold through response R       →  σ_reco(λ; b)    gen → reco
    Step 4   ratio vs λ_central           →  rnorm(b, proc)  handed to rabbit

Steps 1–3 build the absolute cross section; Step 4 forms the per-bin variation
the fit consumes.

Code split: Steps 1–2 (the datacard-free physics — btgrid integral → matched
σ_gen on a gen grid, from btgrid + λ_central + gen edges) live in
:class:`~wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.sigma_gen.SigmaGenModel`. This class
is the loader/rabbit adapter: it resolves λ_central, the gen grid, and (in the
reco path) R / N_gen from the datacard, holds a ``SigmaGenModel`` as
``self.core``, and adds Steps 3–4. ``_sigma_gen_at`` / ``_sigma_YqT_native_at``
alias the core; its physics attributes (``eff_central``, ``np_model``,
``sigma_ns``, …) are reachable as ``model.<name>`` via ``__getattr__``.

NP physical validity: a wrong-sign point (λ2_ν < 0, or the λ2_eff < 0
divergence) makes the form factors anti-damping and the differential σ(qT)
oscillate negative, but the qT-rebin into the coarse gen grid averages that away
— so the binned σ_gen, σ_reco and likelihood stay smooth and positive, and the
fit gets no signal from the likelihood to avoid the unphysical region.
Enforcement is the rabbit ``Regularizer`` ``np_damping_wall.NPDampingWall`` (a
one-sided hinge on the λ, via ``-r``; hardness via ``--regularizationStrength``),
encoding the tanh_2 damping conditions (CS: λ2_ν ≥ 0, λ4_ν ≥ 0; TMD: λ2_Y ≥ 0
and 3·λ∞²·λ4 + λ2_Y³ ≥ 0). Postfit-only validity checks (``np_damping_ok``,
``spectrum_negativity``) live in ``param_model_diagnostics``.

Indices: Q, Y, qT are the btgrid axes (mass / rapidity / qT); g = gen bin
(ptVGen, absYVGen); b = reco bin (ptll, yll, cosThetaStarll_quantile,
phiStarll_quantile). λ splits into λ_eff (F_eff) and λ_ν (γ_ν^NP).

=============================================================================
Step 1 — σ_resum(λ; g): the resummed prediction from the bT grid
=============================================================================

(1a) Per-(Q, Y, qT) bT-space (Hankel) integral — the NP parameters enter HERE:

    σ(Q, Y, qT; λ) = qT · ∫ dbT  bT · J₀(qT·bT)
                          · I_pert(Q, Y, qT;  b*(bT))
                          · exp[ C_ν(Q, Y, qT;  bT) · γ_ν^NP(b*(bT); λ_ν) ]
                          · F_eff(Y;  b*(bT); λ_eff)

Each factor, bare bT vs the b*-frozen b̄T:

  bT          bare bT, the Hankel integration variable. Enters ONLY the
              measure factor bT and the Fourier kernel J₀(qT·bT). The leading
              qT· prefactor is SCETlib's x = qT·bT integration convention.
  b*(bT)      the b*-prescription b_star_global(bT), cached as ``b_bar``: bT
              frozen below b_max so the NP factors never reach the Landau pole.
              EVERY NP-carrying factor is evaluated at b*(bT) — I_pert, γ_ν^NP,
              and F_eff — never at bare bT.
  I_pert      perturbative bT-space integrand with NP off. Cached per
              (Q, Y, qT) along the bT axis; λ-independent.
  C_ν         coefficient of γ_ν^NP in the rapidity (CS) log evolution. Cached
              per (Q, Y, qT) AND bT — a full (Nbins, Nbt) array; λ-independent.
              Taken at the BARE bT: the lone NP-exponent factor NOT frozen to
              b* (per the SCETlib convention).
              Because it varies with bT it sits inside the bT integral (not a
              constant out front); because it varies with Q the Q integral
              cannot be collapsed ahead of the fit — the λ-dependence does not
              factor through ∫dQ (exp is nonlinear in C_ν·γ_ν^NP).
  γ_ν^NP      CS-side NP rapidity anomalous dimension; depends on b*(bT) and
              λ_ν only (no Q/Y/qT). λ-dependent.
  F_eff       TMD-effective NP factor; depends on Y² and b*(bT) and λ_eff only
              (no Q/qT). λ-dependent.

Only γ_ν^NP and F_eff carry λ; everything else (bT, J₀, I_pert, C_ν, b*) is
λ-independent and precomputed at construction (the bT·J₀ kernel, bT Simpson
weights, arctan_Q² Q-weights). The reconstruction uses a memory-factorized layout
(deduplicated (I_pert, C_ν) rows + J₀ on the unique-qT grid + Simpson-as-matmul),
~6× smaller than the dense (Nbins, Nbt) and small enough for a 32 GB GPU; it is
memoized in a ``.npz`` next to ``combined_btgrid.pkl`` (staleness auto-detected)
so repeat constructions skip the ~18 GB raw load.

(1b) Integrate over Q, then rebin onto the gen grid:

    σ_resum(λ; g) = rebin_{qT→ptVGen, |Y|→absYVGen} [ ∫_{Q_lo}^{Q_hi} dQ  σ(Q, Y, qT; λ) ]

The Q integral uses an arctan_Q² Simpson rule (the x = arctan((Q²−q0²)/(q0·Γ))
transform flattens the Breit-Wigner Z peak). The (Y, qT) result is rebinned
(Simpson) onto the unfolding hist's gen edges: qT → ptVGen, and the signed btgrid
Y axis folded into |Y| → absYVGen. The |Y| fold is valid because NP is
Y-symmetric (F_eff depends on Y², γ_ν^NP doesn't depend on Y at all).

=============================================================================
Step 2 — σ_gen(λ; g): add the NP-independent fixed-order nonsingular
=============================================================================

    σ_gen(λ; g) = σ_resum(λ; g) + σ_ns(g)

    σ_ns(g)     = rebin_{qT→ptVGen, |Y|→absYVGen} [ σ_DYTurbo^FO − σ_SCETlib-sing^FO ]

The fixed-order matching adds the nonsingular piece σ_ns = (DYTurbo fixed order)
− (SCETlib singular fixed order), from the original FO inputs (the
``…_nnlo_sing…combined.pkl`` and the DYTurbo ``results_…scetlibmatch.txt``),
Q-windowed to [Q_lo, Q_hi], |Y|-folded, zeroed below qt_cutoff, and summed onto
the (ptVGen, absYVGen) gen bins (see :func:`compute_nonsingular_gen`).

σ_ns is NP-INDEPENDENT (the same for every λ) and added at GEN level, so it folds
through the same response R as σ_resum in Step 3. Because the fit uses a ratio
(Step 3), σ_ns DILUTES the NP variation where the FO dominates (high qT). σ_ns is
ALWAYS included (it is what the histmaker nominal carries); for resum-only
diagnostics subtract the exposed ``sigma_ns`` from ``sigma_gen_central`` (and
re-fold with ``R`` for reco level).

Known limitation — qT > 100 GeV truncation. Both σ_gen ingredients stop at
qT = 100 (the bT grid and the DYTurbo FO input), so σ_gen(λ; g) ≡ 0 above 100,
while R and N_gen lump the full unbounded qT > last_edge into the (last_edge, 100]
overflow (PTVGEN_OVERFLOW_EDGE, see :mod:`response_matrix`). The under-fed overflow
makes the top in-range reco bin (ptll [37, 44]) ~3% low vs the histmaker nominal
and trips the agreement guard, but does NOT bias the fit: the missing piece is
fixed-order, NP-independent, so it cancels in the Step-4 ratio. A high-ptll
extension would need DYTurbo FO past 100, higher bT-grid/overflow ceilings, and
the histmaker correction remade (it shares the truncated inputs).

=============================================================================
Step 3 — σ_reco(λ; b): fold gen → reco through the response matrix
=============================================================================

    P(b | g)     = R_raw(b, g) / N_gen(g)               (efficiency × migration)
    σ_reco(λ; b) = Σ_g  P(b | g) · σ_gen(λ; g)

g = gen bin (ptVGen, |Y|), summed over by Σ_g; b = reco bin — the fit channel's
axes, any prefix subset of the canonical (ptll, yll, cosThetaStarll_quantile,
phiStarll_quantile) order (e.g. a 2D ptll-yll fit; the embedded 4D R is
marginalized over the missing axes, see ``_marginalize_R_reco``). P(b | g) is
the gen→reco map (one
reco column per gen bin), so σ_reco is σ_gen pushed through the detector; Σ_g is
``tf.linalg.matvec(self.R, σ_gen_flat)``. Pure detector folding — no λ_central or
ratio here (that is Step 4).

Factors (all loaded by :mod:`response_matrix`; see it for the hist mechanics):

  R_raw(b, g)   reco×gen yield from the unfolding histmaker output
                (``nominal_prefsr_yieldsUnfolding``, sample Zmumu): slice
                acceptance=True (gen-fiducial), then project to reco×gen —
                which SUMS the helicitySig axis. R is filled with
                ``nominal_weight_helicity``, a PARTITION of the event weight
                into the 8 helicity pieces that ADD BACK UP, so the physical
                yield is the helicitySig SUM. Units: reco-selected,
                gen-fiducial weighted event counts (already × reco efficiency).
  N_gen(g)      gen-total normalizer: the xnorm ``prefsr`` hist, gen-fiducial
                but BEFORE reco selection. Takes the UL component
                (helicitySig = −1), NOT the sum — N_gen is filled with
                ``csAngularMoments``, a moment expansion whose A_i bins (0..7)
                do NOT sum to σ (some are negative); UL is the
                angular-integrated total.
                ⚠ Same axis as R, OPPOSITE reduction: R is a weight partition
                (SUM helicitySig), N_gen is a moment expansion (take UL).
                Taking UL of R instead would discard the angular partition and
                inflate the closure ~15×.

Why N_gen and not the reco-passing marginal Σ_b R_raw(b, g): that marginal
already carries efficiency, so dividing by it cancels efficiency (migration-only)
and closes far worse — efficiency is strongly gen-dependent (ε ≈ 0.07–0.54 here).
N_gen(g), the true generated total, makes P = R_raw/N_gen the theory-independent
gen→reco map. σ_gen, R, N_gen must all sit at the same (pre-FSR) gen level; the
postfsr variants close ~1% worse.

=============================================================================
Step 4 — rnorm(b, proc): the per-reco-bin variation handed to rabbit
=============================================================================

    ratio(b)       = σ_reco(λ; b) / σ_reco(λ_central; b)
    rnorm(b, proc) = 1 + (ratio(b) − 1) · [proc is signal]   (1 in every other proc)

The only object that leaves the model: compute() returns rnorm(b, proc), and
rabbit multiplies the signal reco template by it (other processes stay at 1).
Dividing by σ_reco(λ_central) (precomputed at construction) cancels the
event-count↔σ scale and overall normalization, so rnorm carries purely the SHAPE
of the per-reco-bin NP variation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters and inputs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8 v1 parameters λ (all factorisable through the current btgrid):

    γ_ν^NP (CS-side):       lambda2_nu, lambda4_nu, lambda_inf_nu
    F_eff  (TMD-effective): lambda2, lambda4, lambda6, delta_lambda2, lambda_inf

λ_central is read from the fit-tensor's metadata, where the histmaker stored
the SCETlib correction's NP runcard (see :mod:`lambda_central`). The np_model and
np_model_nu strings are fixed at construction (from λ_central). All λ values are
TF Variables, differentiable in the fit.

=============================================================================
Postfit Hessian / covariance (uncertainties on λ)
=============================================================================

rabbit's covariance step differentiates the bT fold once per fit parameter
(~3754) and can't see it depends only on the ≤8 λ, re-materializing the
(Ng × Nbt) ≈ 8.75 GB slab per parameter → ~33 TB → OOM. Fix: a straight-through
surrogate (``_ratio_straightthrough`` + ``_ratio_compact_jac`` /
``_ratio_compact_hess``) exposing only a compact quadratic in λ to autodiff
(J = dratio/dλ, K = d²ratio/dλ² by forward-mode AD) while the exact ratio value
stays under stop_gradient, so the big slab never enters the differentiated graph.
Enable via the ``hessian_straightthrough=1`` / ``hessian_gn=1`` spec tokens and a
two-pass run (fit ``--noHessian``, then covariance at the postfit with
``--externalPostfit --noFit``). GN (``hessian_gn=1``, drops the K term) is exact
for Asimov and the default; full-K is for real/toy data. Do NOT enable during the
fit. Full derivation, GN-vs-full-K, and the exact commands: ``docs/HESSIAN_PLAN.md``.

        Usage::
            --paramModel wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.SCETlibNPParamModel [key=value ...]

        Parameters
        ----------
        indata
            rabbit's input-data structure (passed by ``ph.load_models``). The
            reco×gen response matrix R (and the gen-total N_gen, axis names +
            edges) is read from ``indata.auxiliary["scetlib_np"]``, embedded in
            the datacard by setupRabbit from a ``mz_dilepton.py --unfolding``
            histmaker output (see :func:`_R_info_from_auxiliary` and
            :mod:`response_matrix`). There is no file-path argument; R always
            comes from the fit input it is consistent with.
        btgrid_dir
            Directory holding the SCETlib bT-grid ``combined_btgrid.pkl``.
            Defaults (when None) to the shared data-area copy next to NanoAOD
            (``_default_btgrid_dir()``, built on the ROOT/narf-free
            ``wremnants.utilities.data_paths.getDataPath()``); pass explicitly
            at non-subMIT sites.
        lambda_central
            Dict with two sub-dicts ``eff_params`` and ``gnu_params`` (same
            shape as returned by :func:`lambda_central.read_lambda_central`).
            By default λ_central is auto-detected from ``indata.metadata``;
            pass this only to override or to support hand-built indata that
            lacks metadata.
        signal_proc
            Name of the signal process whose reco yields get the per-bin
            ratio. Other processes get factor 1.
        Q_lo, Q_hi
            Z mass window for the Q-integration on the btgrid.
        poi_params
            Tuple of parameter names (subset of ``ALL_PARAMS``) to treat as
            POIs (reported as POIs in the fit output). The rest are reported
            as model nuisances (npou). The POI vs POU split is independent
            of the prior assignment (see ``prior_sigmas``).
        priors
            Enable Gaussian priors on the λ parameters (spec token
            ``priors=1``). Rabbit applies priors whenever a ParamModel
            *declares* ``prior_sigmas``; there is no rabbit-side CLA (the
            old ``--paramModelPriors`` flag was dropped in WMass/rabbit#133),
            the model itself decides. This token IS that decision: only when
            set does the model declare ``prior_sigmas``. Default off →
            everything floats free.
        prior_sigmas
            Per-name override for the Gaussian prior σ on each parameter:
            a Mapping, or as spec token the comma-separated string form
            ``prior_sigmas=lambda2=0.3,delta_lambda2=nan`` (same format as
            ``xparam_default``). Defaults come from the per-model registry
            (``params.EFF_MODEL_PARAMS`` / ``GNU_MODEL_PARAMS``); a σ of ``None``
            there floats the param free.
        nonsingular_fo_sing, nonsingular_dyturbo
            Paths to the σ_ns inputs (SCETlib singular pkl / DYTurbo
            scetlibmatch txt); default to the wremnants-data
            TheoryCorrections copies. σ_ns is always included: the matched
            σ_gen^matched(λ) = σ_gen^resum(λ) + σ_ns is what the histmaker
            nominal carries; resum-only diagnostics subtract ``sigma_ns``.
        nonsingular_qt_cutoff
            Low-qT cutoff (GeV) below which σ_ns is zeroed (the FO−singular
            difference is numerically unreliable at tiny qT).
        xparam_default
            Comma-separated ``name=value,...`` string shifting the fit START
            (and the prior mean) off the runcard's λ_central, for closure /
            injection tests. The truth (ratio denominator) is NOT moved.
        hessian_straightthrough
            Expose compact λ-derivatives (J, optionally K) to autodiff while
            keeping the exact value, for the one-shot two-pass covariance
            recipe ONLY (see the module docstring); never set during a fit.
        hessian_gn
            With ``hessian_straightthrough``: Gauss-Newton, keep J and drop
            the K term (exact for Asimov, where the residual vanishes).
        gen_level
            Gen-level σUL fit mode (spec token ``gen_level=1``). The fit channel
            IS the gen (ptVGen, |Y|) binning, so there is NO response matrix and
            NO gen→reco fold (Step 3 is skipped): compute() returns the
            per-GEN-bin ratio σ_gen(λ) / σ_gen(λ_central) from Steps 1–2. The
            gen binning is read from the single fit channel's axes, so no
            ``scetlib_np`` auxiliary / R / N_gen is needed. Used for the
            direct-theory σUL closure (this ParamModel as the λ model, fit
            against injected gen-level σUL pseudodata).
        check_agreement
            Run the in-fit reco agreement guard at construction (default ON;
            spec token ``check_agreement=0`` disables). It compares the model's
            σ_reco(λ_central) SHAPE to the card's signal nominal template
            and trips if ANY bin's |σ_reco(λ_c)/card_nominal − 1| exceeds
            ``check_agreement_threshold``, catching the misuse where the
            model's λ_central baseline doesn't match the card.
        check_agreement_threshold
            Per-bin trip threshold for ``check_agreement`` (fractional;
            default 0.005 = 0.5%).
        check_agreement_strict
            Raise instead of warn when the guard trips (spec token
            ``check_agreement_strict=1``). Default warns (lists worst bins).
        check_agreement_min_yield
            Optional reference-yield floor (fraction of the max reco bin) below
            which bins are ignored by the guard, suppressing sparse/near-empty
            corner bins where a shape residual is meaningless. Default 0 (every
            bin counts).
        np_model_fit, np_model_nu_fit
            Optional override of the F_eff / γ_ν functional form used for the
            NUMERATOR σ(λ) (spec tokens ``np_model_fit=...`` / ``np_model_nu_fit=
            tanh_6``). The DENOMINATOR (central σ(λ_c), the ratio's reference) is
            ALWAYS the card's form — fixed by λ_central, immutable — so the model
            stays consistent with the histmaker template. Default (None) → the
            numerator uses the card form too (rnorm(λ_c)=1, unchanged behaviour).
            Setting e.g. ``np_model_nu_fit=tanh_6`` makes the fit predict in
            tanh_6 while transporting from the tanh_2 baseline:
            rnorm = σ^(fit)(λ) / σ^(card)(λ_c). NOTE this is a model change —
            validate the fit form against a matching SCETlib reference before
            trusting results, and ``lambda6_nu`` (the tanh_6 b⁶ coefficient) is a
            normal fittable λ (default 0, inert under tanh_2).
